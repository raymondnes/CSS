        <ul>
        <li>“How can I lose when I came here with nothing?” First is ambition. By all means, punch above your weight. Ride life with laughter and style. Earn the respect of those you admire. Try your hands at wit and wry humor. Play with ambition and pursue mastery.</li>
        <li>Covet the best memories and give amazing sex. Apply yourself to positions that would traditionally be beyond you; test your mettle. Leave the cocoon of inertia. Try to try. If nothing matters, at least dignify the process. Technically, you cannot lose.</li>
        <li>“How can I lose when I came here with nothing?” Second is  contentment. All of life is suffering — this is Buddha's first "Noble Truth". The source of this suffering is our endless desire. So by all means, play also with contentment. Play with kids, as you do adults.</li>
        <li>Savor the food when you bite. Don’t take yourself too seriously; you’re not all that. No one is. Try to make others happy; life is not all about you. Have at least one aspect of life you fully control— no external pressure— and take full responsibility for the outcomes.
        </li>
        <li>Accept opportunities for growth, but don’t be in a hurry to grow up. Reach for the skies, but try not to lose sight of things larger than self. Yes, ambition is necessary, but ambition does not always have to be “grand”. And oh, call home; family is cooler than you think.
        </li>
        <li>We take only to let go. We live only to die; this is the tectonic structure of the universe. Nothing is enough. The “best” is only an ideal again which we measure the material world. There will always be more positions to apply to, greater sex, wittier people, more ambitions.</li>
        <li>This is the ultimate paradox. I want to be great yet what value is that if life is all vanity? But no, we can be museums of ambition and contentment. We can discern when to fly and when to perch. Life without both is painfully empty; a form of death itself.</li>
        <li>How do we know when to draw the line? Of God I ask for discernment. My mortal intellect is insufficient. I believe that everything is made of matter. And that there’s a ‘matter’ behind that matter. Maybe that’s God. I believe he hears me. I can't make sense of it any other way.</li>
        <li>“How can I lose when I came here with nothing?” Acceptance. We can unconditionally accept all of life and love it: the highs, lows, the meaning, the meaninglessness, the melody, the melodilessness, the pain and suffering. Actually until we die, we have no choice. We’re all in.
